## Week 1 - Overview
:::

In this module we discuss basics of probability, the mathematical background of statistical modeling and inference.

#### Learning Objectives

1.  Understand basic notions of probability theory: sample space, events, probability as a set function
2.  Understand frequentist and bayesian interpretation of probability
3.  Calculate probability of various events in finite sample space with equally likely outcomes
4.  Understand the notion of conditional probability
5.  Understand Total Probability Formula and Bayes' Formula

1.  DS involves stochastic (random nature) models
2.  Fundamental Notions:
    i.  Outcomes of an experiment of interest
    ii. Event (Collection of possible outcomes)
    iii. Sample Space (collection of all possible outcomes)
    iv. probability (quantifying the level of certainty about an event)
3.  Classical Definition of Probability
    i.  if a sample space <b>S</b> is finite and consists of equally likely outcomes
        a.  the probability of any event <b> $A \subseteq S$ </b> is <b> $P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes in } (A)}{\text{Number of all outcomes in } (S)}$ </b>
        b.  Also called <b>cardinality</b> of event A.
    ii. Infinite Sets are different
        a.  We use axioms and set operations.

1.  Complement: $A^C$
    i.  $x \in A^C \iff x \notin A$ ( and $x \in S$ )
2.  Union: $A \cup B$
    i.  $x \in A \cup B \iff$ ( $x \in A$ <b> OR </b> $x \in B$ )
3.  Intersection: $A \cap B$
    i.  $x \in A \cap B \iff$ ( $x \in A$ <b> AND </b> $x \in B$ )
4.  De Morgan's Laws:
    i.  $( A \cup B )^C = A^C \cap B^C$
    ii. $( A \cap B)^C = A^C \cup B^C$

1.  For any event E, \(0 \leq P(E) \leq 1 \)
2. \( P(S) = 1 \)
3. For any countable sequence of Mutually exclusive events \( E_1 \), \( E_2 \), ....
    i. in other words, \( E_i \cap E_j = 0 \) whenever \( i \neq j \) , Then:
    
\[
P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(E_i)
\]

4. Notes:
    i. Adding a dot above the union set notation is meant to suggest the set is disjoint, suggesting we can apply axiom 3's countable additivity. 
\[
\dot{\bigcup}_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i
\]
    ii. The intersection \( A \cap B \) of two events will be written shortly as \( AB \). So, \( P(AB) \) represents the probability that both events, \( A \) and \( B \) happen.
5. Properties of Probability
    i. \( P(0) = 0 \)
    ii. Let \( A_1, A_2, \dots ,  A_n \) be disjoint sets. Then:
\[
P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A_i)
\]
    iii. \( P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) \)
    iv. \( A \subseteq B \mapsto P(A) \leq P(B) \)
    v. \( P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(AB)\) 
        - <b>Note:</b> \( P(A \cap\ B) = P(AB)\)
